            <h4>Kale a little too intense for you? Sugiuchi also loves spinach, which contains many of the same
                nutrients
                but is “a little milder,” she notes. Spinach is a perfect base for this fruit-forward juice, which is
                great for beginners who want to try juicing, but don’t love the taste of veggies..</h4>

                A, C, K, and B6, plus calcium and manganese. And you won’t even notice that you’re drinking it, thanks
                to a bright combination of lemon, apple, and parsley.</h4>

            <h4>Technically a smoothie, this plant-powered blend has a lighter consistency if you want something a
                little more filling than your typical juice. Greek yogurt adds some quality protein, while celery, lime,
                kale, and cucumbers give it that vibrant green hue.</h4>

            <h4>You’ll use a blender instead of a juicer for this recipe, but the result is much closer to the
                consistency of a juice than a thicker smoothie. It’s packed with vitamin C, thanks to spinach and kiwi.
                Plus, a bit of coconut water adds sweetness to the final product.</h4>

                all-in on the root. You’ll drink an entire head of fresh kale—along with its vitamins, minerals, and
                those Sugiuchi-approved phytonutrients—without even realizing it. </h4>
